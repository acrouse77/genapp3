                        Variation at this location in the CYP1A2 gene has been associated with the speed of caffeine metabolism in humans. The CYP1A2 gene encodes a member of a family of proteins that are responsible for metabolism of nutrients and medications . Individuals
                        who have the letter “C” at this location in one or both of of their copies of this genetic region are more likely to slow caffeine metabolizers while an individual who has the letter “A” at this location in both of their copies
                        of this gene is more likely to be a fast caffeine metabolizer [PMID 18759349].

                    <p class="card-text">The effect that alcohol consumption has on an individual is dependent on a variety of factors, including the speed to which its chemicals are broken down and removed from the body. A subset of people have what is known as a flush reaction
                        after consuming alcohol - which can present as dizziness, nausea, headaches and flushing (turning red). This reaction can be severe and highly uncomfortable. Research has shown that whether a person has a flush reaction after consuming
                        alcohol is due to genetic variation within two genes, ALDH2 and ADH1B, which encode important enzymes in the alcohol metabolism process.

                    <p class="card-text">Blond hair color is determined by a pigment called melanin. People with higher levels of the brown-black form of melanin have darker hair and those with lower levels have lighter hair that may be considered blond. Roughly 20 percent of 23andMe customers report having either light blond or dark blond hair. Several genetic variants have been found to influence whether or not someone has blond hair. This report provides results for three variants that are known to play a very strong role in determining blond hair color.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">There are two types of melanin: a brown-black form known as eumelanin and a yellow-red form known as pheomelanin. The amount of eumelanin and pheomelanin you produce has important consequences on the way you look. In most people, eumelanin levels dominate, leading to variation in brown-black pigmentation. People with higher levels of eumelanin have darker hair and those with lower levels of eumelanin have lighter hair that may be considered blond. A small subset of the world's population has high levels of pheomelanin, leading to red hair and light skin color.

                    <p class="card-text">One marker (rs12821256) that affects pigmentation is near a gene called KITLG. The KITLG gene is believed to affect pigmentation by controlling the movement, survival, and growth of melanin-producing cells called melanocytes. A second marker (rs1667394) we report on is located near the OCA2 gene, which codes for a protein located in melanocytes.                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">About twenty percent of 23andMe customers report having blond hair, though this number varies greatly based on ethnic background. Blond hair is most common in Northern European populations, with hair color going from light to dark as you move from Northern to Southern Europe. Blond hair is also occasionally found in non-European populations, but the genetics underlying blond hair in such groups is unique. For instance, roughly five to ten percent of Solomon Islanders have blond hair that is caused by a single genetic variant in a gene called TYRP1.</p>
                    <p class="card-text">rs12913832 is a SNP near the OCA2 gene that may be functionally linked to blue or brown eye color, due to a lowering of promoter activity of the OCA2 gene. Blue eye color is associated with the rs12913832(G;G) genotype.[PMID 18172690, PMID 18252222]rs12913832-T (brown eye) homozygotes compared to rs12913832-C (blue eye). correlations with skin, eye, and hair color variation.</p>

                      A 2007 study based on the Icelanders and Dutch concluded that individuals with an rs12821256(C) allele were ~2x fold more likely to have blond than brown hair color. The specific odds ratio claimed per (C) allele is 2.32, p = 5.5 x 10-14.[PMID 17952075]
