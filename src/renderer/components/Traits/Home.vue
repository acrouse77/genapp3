                    to affect apocrine sweat glands by reducing secretion of odorous molecules and its precursors.  This make using deoderant unneccesary for the select lucky few.  
                    </p>
                    <p>This variant also affects earwax consistancy.  Earwax is ubiquitous to everyone but you may not know that it comes two types - wet and dry. Wet earwax is the most common form in most populations (except East Asian) and can be described as yellow to brown colored and sticky. The
                        less common dry earwax is often described as grey in color and as the name suggests, is dry and flakey. Earwax type is determined by variation in a single gene, ABCC11. No matter which type of earwax you have, it serves an important
                        job in your body keeping your ear canals clean.

                    <p class="card-text">The effect that alcohol consumption has on an individual is dependent on a variety of factors, including the speed to which its chemicals are broken down and removed from the body. A subset of people have what is known as a flush reaction
                        after consuming alcohol - which can present as dizziness, nausea, headaches and flushing (turning red). This reaction can be severe and highly uncomfortable. Research has shown that whether a person has a flush reaction after consuming
                        alcohol is due to genetic variation within two genes, ALDH2 and ADH1B, which encode important enzymes in the alcohol metabolism process.

                        Variation at this location in the TAS2R38 gene has been associated with likelihood being able to perceive bitter taste in humans. The TAS2R38 gene is one of many “taste receptor” genes that encode proteins important for perception of a variety of different flavors. Individuals who have the letter “C” at this location in one or both of their copies of this genetic region are likely to be able to perceive bitter taste while an individual who has the letter “G” at this location in both of their copies of this gene may not be able to perceive bitter taste in some foods [PMID 12595690].</p>

The ACTN3 gene is one of a group of genes that encode structural proteins important in skeletal muscle.
