    <!-- <p><img class="rounded float-xs-right img-thumbnail img-responsive" style="max-width: 50%;" src="/img/RA_chapt_intro.jpg"></p> -->

    <p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder primarily characterized by chronic joint inflammation, especially in the smaller joints of the feet and hands. Over time, this inflammation can cause joint damage and lead to limitations on movement
        and activity. RA can also lead to inflammation of other tissues as well as weight loss, anemia, a low grade fever, and a decrease in energy.<sup>1</sup> RA is thought to affect up to 1% of the population worldwide.2 Most individuals develop symptoms in
        mid- to late adulthood, and, often, symptoms will appear and subside in a pattern of flares and remissions throughout a person&#39;s lifetime.<sup>1</sup></p>
    <h2 id="subtypes">Subtypes</h2>
    <p>RA is typically divided into two subtypes: seropositive and seronegative. Individuals with seropositive RA (approximately 60-80% of those affected) have a particular antibody present in their blood that is thought to initiate an immune response to
        body tissues and cause RA symptoms. The presence of the anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) in a blood test can confirm a diagnosis of RA. It also may be detected in individuals without RA symptoms up to 5 to 10 years before signs of the
        condition appear.<sup>3</sup></p>
    <p>For the remainder of individuals with RA, neither ACPA nor a related antibody called rheumatoid factor is found in the blood, yet clinical symptoms are present. This type of RA is referred to as seronegative. A diagnosis of RA can be confirmed in
        these cases by clinical presentation as well as X-rays showing characteristic bone and joint damage. Knowing the subtype of an individual&#39;s RA diagnosis is important, as many treatments for seropositive RA are not as effective in those with
        seronegative RA.<sup>4</sup></p>
    <p>Although seropositive and seronegative forms of RA have long been used to categorize the condition, physicians and researchers now understand there are probably many more subtypes of RA based on whether they occur along with other types of autoimmune
        disorders.<sup>4</sup></p>
    <p>Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) is a particularly complex form of rheumatoid arthritis that causes symptom onset in children under the age of 17. While many of the symptoms are similar to the more common form of RA, JRA can also create growth
        problems as a result of bone and joint damage in growing children. It remains unclear whether JRA is a subtype of RA or actually a separate disease process. Risk factors included in this chapter are known to be associated with rheumatoid arthritis
        but not necessarily the juvenile form.<sup>4</sup></p>
    <h2 id="treatment-and-management">Treatment and Management</h2>
    <p>For someone diagnosed with RA, medications both to manage pain as well as slow the progression of disease may be recommended. Some of these medications have side effects, including but not limited to suppression of parts of the immune system, that
        can cause other medical problems. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to replace severely damaged joints.<sup>5</sup></p>
    <h1 id="-risk-factors-"><strong>Risk Factors</strong></h1>
    <h2 id="inheritance-and-family-history">Inheritance and Family History</h2>
    <p>RA is a multifactorial condition, meaning that both genetic and environmental factors combine to affect risk to develop the disease.2 Heritability is a term used to estimate the amount that genetic factors contribute to the difference in disease risk
        among individuals. For seropositive RA, heritability is estimated to be approximately 50%,, meaning that around 50% of the variability in disease risk among individuals is due to genetic differences.6 This amount is lower in seronegative RA, which
        is thought to have a heritability of approximately 20%.6 Family history information as well as genetic testing may be able to identify some of the genetic risk factors that contribute to the heritability of RA.<sup>7</sup></p>
    <p>Family studies have suggested that individuals who have a first degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) with RA are at an increased risk to develop the condition themselves. The precise increase in risk is not well-defined, but reports suggest
        there is a four to eight fold increase in likelihood for these individuals to develop RA, with the gender of the affected family member modulating this risk.<sup>8</sup></p>
    <h2 id="other-risk-factors">Other Risk Factors</h2>
    <p>A number of other factors are known to be associated with the risk to develop RA. The likelihood of developing RA increases with age, especially once individuals are over the age of 34, with a peak in the fifth decade.2,9 RA is less likely in those
        identifying as Asian or Hispanic when compared to Caucasians and African Americans.9 Women are two to three times more likely to develop RA than men.<sup>2</sup></p>
    <p>Smoking is a well-described risk factor for RA.2 Smokers are approximately one and one half to two times more likely to develop seropositive RA, and an increased risk has been shown to persist even among former smokers.10 Obesity has also been shown
        to increase the risk to develop RA.11 Certain changes in a person&#39;s gut bacteria, or intestinal microbiome, have been implicated in RA risk as well, though these are not yet well-understood.12 In addition, infection with certain periodontal
        diseases and occupational exposure to silica dust have also each been considered as possible RA risk factors.13 Furthermore, lower socioeconomic status and fewer years of education have been associated with an increased risk of inflammation, which
        is a key to the disease process of RA.<sup>2</sup></p>
