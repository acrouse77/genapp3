    <h2 id="subtypes">Subtypes</h2>
    <p>CAD can be divided into several subtypes: asymptomatic, angina pectoris, and myocardial infarction.^2^ Asymptomatic CAD occurs when an individual&#39;s cardiac vessels have blockage, but that individual does not have pain or other symptoms of disease.
        Over time, asymptomatic CAD may progress to angina pectoris and myocardial infarction.^3^</p>
    <p>Angina pectoris, or chest pain, occurs when the heart muscle does not receive as much blood as it needs due to blockage of the arteries. An individual with angina may experience feelings of pressure, fullness, squeezing, or pain in their chest region
        or in other regions including the neck, jaw, shoulder, back, or arm. Angina may be further divided into stable and unstable subtypes. In stable angina, an individual experiences multiple episodes of angina with similar frequency, intensity, and
        duration. In cases of unstable angina, an individual with a previously stable condition may experience angina with increasing frequency and severity. Unstable angina requires medical attention as it signals that myocardial infarction is likely
        imminent.^1,4,5^</p>
    <p>Myocardial infarction, or heart attack, occurs when blood flow to the heart is either severely diminished or totally cut off. This can occur when a plaque breaks, which causes a clot to form around the plaque. The clot may block the blood vessel,
        depriving the heart of oxygen and leading to damage or death of heart muscle. The severity of a heart attack depends on the particular artery that is blocked and the amount of time between the event and treatment. With proper treatment and lifestyle
        changes, many individuals who experience a heart attack may prevent additional damage to their hearts in the future.^1,4,5^</p>
    <h2 id="treatment-and-management">Treatment and Management</h2>
    <p>An individual with CAD may be treated with a variety of medications, including anticoagulants and drugs that change the way the heart beats. For those with more advanced disease, surgical procedures including angioplasty, bypass, or stenting may be
        required. In addition to medications and surgical options, lifestyle changes such as avoiding tobacco, becoming more active, and making good nutritional choices.1</p>
    <h1 id="-risk-factors-"><strong>Risk Factors</strong></h1>
    <h2 id="inheritance-and-family-history">Inheritance and Family History</h2>
    <p>CAD is a multifactorial condition, meaning that both genetic and environmental factors combine to affect risk to develop the disease. Heritability is a term used to estimate the amount that genetic factors contribute to the difference in disease risk
        among individuals. For CAD, heritability is estimated to be between 50 and 60%, meaning that between 50 and 60 percent of the variability in disease risk among individuals is due to genetic differences. Family history information as well as genetic
        testing may be able to identify some of the genetic risk factors that contribute to the heritability of CAD.^6,7,8,9^</p>
    <p>Family studies have suggested that individuals who have a first degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) with CAD are at an increased risk to develop the condition themselves. The precise increase in risk is not well-defined, but reports suggest
        there is up to a three fold increase in likelihood for these individuals to develop CAD. It is estimated that the the risk for an individual to develop CAD increases with greater numbers of affected close relatives and younger onset of disease
        in these relatives.^4,7,8,9^</p>
    <h2 id="other-risk-factors">Other Risk Factors</h2>
    <p>A number of other factors are known to be associated with the risk to develop CAD. The likelihood of developing CAD increases with age. The risk of CAD is higher in African American populations than Caucasian populations and lower in the Hispanic
        population. The average age at which CAD develops in women is approximately 7-10 years later than men.^3,5,10^</p>
    <p>Cigarette smoking is a well-described risk factor for the development of CAD, with the likelihood of developing CAD increased by approximately two times among smokers. This is due to the fact that smoking can trigger a buildup of plaque in a person&#39;s
        arteries and increase the risk of blood clots forming in those narrowed arteries. The amount and duration of smoking affects the degree to which this risk is increased. Importantly, studies have shown that individuals who stop smoking almost immediately
        begin to see risk reduction and return to nearly baseline population risk for CAD over time.1,11</p>
    <p>Having high blood pressure is also a risk factor for developing CAD, as it causes the muscle of the heart to become thicker and stiffer due to overwork. In addition to high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol can also increase a person&#39;s risk
        for CAD by increasing the likelihood of plaque formation. Both of these factors can be influenced by a person&#39;s lifestyle in terms of activity level and diet.^1, 11^</p>
    <p>Another risk factor for CAD is diabetes mellitus. The risk is lower if a person&#39;s blood sugar levels are under control. Over ⅔ of people over the age of 65 die from some form of heart disease, so it is critical for those with diabetes to manage
        their condition carefully and work to reduce other risk factors.^1,11^</p>
    <p>Many studies have demonstrated that low physical activity and obesity are also risk factors for the development of CAD. In fact, people who are inactive have nearly twice the risk to develop CAD as those who are more active. Fortunately, risk reduction
        can be seen even with modest amounts of physical activity; as an individual&#39;s activity level increases, their risk decreases. The amount that obesity alone contributes to risk for coronary artery disease is unclear; however, it is linked to
        other risk factors such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. A healthy diet can decrease a person&#39;s risk for CAD by affecting other risk factors such as obesity, cholesterol, and blood pressure.^1,11^</p>
    <p>It is important to keep in mind that many of these environmental and lifestyle risk factors can be changed in order to lower risk. A person&#39;s risk increases further with each additional factor modified, so addressing even one area can begin to
        lower overall risk. Because many of these risk factors are linked together by lifestyle habits, the American Heart Association recommends that the best way for a person to lower their total risk for CAD is to avoid tobacco, become more active,
        and choose good nutrition.^1^</p>
