                <h1 class="text-primary">Description</h1>

                    <p>Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is an eye disease characterized by loss of central vision due to changes in the macular region of the retina.<sup>1</sup> In the United States, AMD has an estimated prevalence of 1 in 2,000 individuals.
                        The prevalence increases with age, affecting more than 11.5% of the population over age 80.<sup>2</sup> AMD is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries.<sup>3</sup> Quality of life can be greatly impacted by AMD, as central vision loss
                        is likely to affect a person&#39;s ability to perform daily activities such as reading, driving, and recognizing faces.<sup>4</sup></p>

                    <h1 class="text-primary">Subtypes</h1>

                    <p>AMD is often divided into two subtypes: dry and wet.<sup>3</sup> Dry AMD makes up the vast majority of AMD cases (85-90%) and is caused by a buildup of yellowish deposits called drusen in the area underneath the retina.3 Drusen buildup leads
                        to weakening and death of the photoreceptor (rod and cone) cells responsible for transmitting light and color information to the brain.<sup>3</sup> It is thought that once drusen builds up to a certain point, the eye responds by generating
                        new blood vessel growth to the area, leading to the development of the more severe wet form of AMD.<sup>3</sup></p>
                    <p>Wet (also called neovascular) AMD results from the overgrowth of new blood vessels underneath the retina.<sup>3</sup> These vessels are often fragile and break, causing scarring of the macula.<sup>3</sup> Although wet AMD accounts for a small portion
                        (10-15%) of total AMD cases, it is responsible for up to 90% of the severe vision loss associated with the disease.<sup>5</sup> All cases of wet AMD progress from dry AMD.<sup>5</sup></p>
                    <h1 class="text-primary">Treatment and Management</h1>

                    <!-- <h2 id="treatment-and-management">Treatment and Management</h2> -->
                    <p>A small percentage of wet AMD cases are responsive to treatments such as laser therapy or injection of drugs that block blood vessel growth.<sup>6</sup> However, most cases of AMD do not have a specific treatment, and vision loss that occurs
                        as a result cannot be reversed. Dietary supplements including zinc and the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin have been shown to decrease the risk of progression to later stages of the disease. Supportive measures appropriate for
                        vision loss of any type may also be used for individuals with AMD.<sup>6</sup></p>

                        <h1>Inheritance and Family History</h1>
                        <p>AMD is a multifactorial condition, meaning that both genetic and environmental factors combine to affect risk to develop the disease.<sup>7</sup> Heritability is a term used to estimate the amount that genetic factors contribute to the difference in disease
                            risk across a population. For AMD, heritability is estimated to be between 45% and 70%, meaning that between 45 and 70 percent of the variability in disease risk among individuals is due to genetic differences.<sup>7</sup> Family history information as
                            well as genetic testing may be able to identify some of the genetic risk factors that contribute to the heritability of AMD.<sup>8,9</sup></p>
                        <p>Family studies have suggested that individuals who have a first degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) with AMD are at an increased risk to develop the condition themselves.8,9 The precise increase in risk is not well-defined, but reports suggest
                            there is a four to ten fold increase in likelihood for these individuals to develop AMD.<sup>8,9</sup></p>
                        <h1>Other Risk Factors</h1>
                        <p>A number of other factors are known to be associated with the risk to develop AMD. As the name of the condition suggests, the likelihood of developing AMD increases with age.<sup>1,3,10,11</sup> Progression to later stages of AMD is somewhat more likely to
                            occur in Caucasians, but there appears to be no difference among races in the development of the early stages of the condition.<sup>6</sup></p>
                        <p>Cigarette smoking is a well-described risk factor for the development of AMD, with the likelihood of developing AMD increased by two to three times among smokers.<sup>5,6,11,12</sup> The amount and duration of smoking affects this increase; individuals with
                            over 40 pack-years have the highest increase in risk (A pack-year is calculated by multiplying the number of packs smoked per day by the number of years smoked).<sup>11,12</sup> Non-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke (living with a smoker for at least
                            5 years) have almost twice the risk of developing AMD.<sup>12</sup> Importantly, one study has shown that individuals who stop smoking for at least 20 years have almost identical risks of developing AMD as those who have never smoked.<sup>11</sup></p>
                        <p>One study has suggested that eight or more hours of sunlight exposure per day and/or outside working conditions may increase the risk of developing AMD.<sup>13</sup> However, sunlight exposure is difficult to study as a risk factor, as it is challenging to
                            calculate exactly how much sun exposure an individual receives.<sup>13</sup></p>
                        <p>Other factors that have been suggested to affect the risk of developing AMD include but are not limited to: gender, obesity, light iris color, hypertension, and increased dietary fat intake.<sup>1,3,7</sup> At this time, these factors&#39; effects on a person&#39;s
                            risk is not completely understood.</p>
